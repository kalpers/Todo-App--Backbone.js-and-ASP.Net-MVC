First of all, I want to give credit to the two sites that I pulled my code from.  Addy Osmani put together a really great Todo app that I felt had a very good JavaScript structure but his code did not include any backend to ASP.Net (https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals).  I would suggest heading over to Addy Osmani github site and check out the readme file because I learned a whole lot about JavaScript AMD from Addy.   The second site from Bit Candies (http://www.bitcandies.com/blog/2012/asp-net-mvc3-restful-application-tutorial-with-backbone-js-part-iv/) helped me out greatly on trying to figure out how to get ASP.Net MVC to talk REST. I searched everywhere on the internet looking for a “how-to” and I found several suggestions but they were not true REST interfaces.  So here is a combination of the two websites so I hope you enjoy.

Update: I just added sort capabilities to the Todo list. Thanks to Jonahlyn Gilstrap (http://jonahlyn.heroku.com/blog/2011/12/02/backbone-drag-and-drop).
